# About 

This neural network has similar background and installation procedure as [ShortGAN neural network](https://github.com/Vlasenko2006/ShortGAN), so we will not detail the installation process and its structure. The main difference from the first scheme is that this neural network has a more advanced generator with `Conv2DTranspose` and `spectral normalization` layers, and it can generate colored images. The demonstrative images have 136 x 206 pixels size.

**Images generted in the beginning of the training (100 epochs):**

**Images generated in the middle of the training (40000 epochs):**
